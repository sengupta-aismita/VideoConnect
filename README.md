🎥 VideoConnect – Real-Time Video Communication Platform (Work in Progress)

VideoConnect is a full-stack real-time communication application currently under development, designed to enable users to connect through live video and messaging.
The project focuses on implementing WebSockets for real-time data exchange along with JWT-based authentication for secure access.

🚧 Project Status

⚠️ Work in Progress
Core real-time communication and video features are actively being developed.

✨ Features (Implemented & Planned)

🔐 JWT-Based Authentication
Secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless session handling.

📡 Real-Time Communication
Instant data exchange using WebSockets (Socket.io).

🎥 Video Calling (In Progress)
Real-time peer-to-peer video communication.

💬 Live Messaging
Real-time chat between authenticated users.

🌐 Room-Based Architecture
Users can create or join rooms for private communication.

🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, JavaScript

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Real-Time Communication: WebSockets (Socket.io)

Other Tools: HTML, CSS, Git, REST APIs

(Tech stack may evolve as development progresses.)

🧠 Learning Objectives

This project is being built to gain hands-on experience with:

Implementing JWT-based authentication in full-stack applications

Securing real-time WebSocket connections

Managing concurrent users and connections

Synchronizing state across clients in real time

Designing scalable real-time systems

🚀 Why This Project Matters

VideoConnect goes beyond traditional CRUD applications by combining authentication, real-time communication, and state synchronization.
It demonstrates the ability to work with advanced backend concepts such as JWT security and WebSocket-driven systems.

🔮 Future Enhancements

Screen sharing

Group video calls

Token refresh & improved auth flows

Connection status indicators

UI/UX improvements

📌 Note

This project is actively being developed as part of continuous learning and experimentation with real-time web technologies.
